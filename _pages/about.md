I am a Ph.D. student studying Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University, primarily advised by Professor [Mauro Maggioni](https://mauromaggioni.duckdns.org/). I am also currently collaborating with [Mateo DÃ­az](https://mateodd25.github.io/) and [Ben Grimmer](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~grimmer/index.html). I obtained a Masters in Mathematics from Tufts University in 2022, and a B.A. in Biochemisty and Economics from Occidental College in 2019. For more details, see my CV.

My research is in Optimal Transportation and Riemannian Optimization, with a focus on asking how we can lift algorithms from the Euclidean setting to more exotic metric spaces. In particular, my current projects center on:

- Computing Barycenters on Unknown Wasserstein Submanifolds;
- Convergence Rate Analysis of Riemannian Bundle Methods.

Outside of my current projects, I am also interested in:

- Statistical Optimal Transportation, and Different Regularization Schemes (Entropic Optimal Transport and Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport;
- Analysis of Wasserstein Gradient Flows, and Different Algorithmic Approximations and Applications thereof;
- Different Approximations for Riemannian Geoemtric Tools (Retractions and Vector Transports) and How to Obtain Quantitive Bounds on Approximation;
- High Dimensional Probability and Geometry, and Statistical Learning Theory.

I am greatful to have been recognized among my many talented peers in recent years. Notably, I have been given the **Rufus P. Isaacs Graduate Fellowship**, which distinguishes promising early graduate students for research within my department, as well being the Sole Recipient across the Whiting School of Engineering of the **2024 Whiting School of Engineering Teaching Assistant Award**, an award given in recognition of excellence and talent as a graduate TA. I am incredibly humbled by these  acolades, and I hope I can rise to these titles through more hardwork and unbridled curiosity.
